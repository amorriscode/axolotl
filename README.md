# Axolotl

Write [Achor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)-compatible Solana programs using TypeScript.

Writing Rust is hard, but safe. It's also the go-to language for writing Solana programs. With Axolotl, you can utilize your web development skills to develop programs for the Solana blockchain. Solana program development has never been this easy.

This project is currently in pre-alpha and is heavily inspired by [Seahorse](https://seahorse-lang.org/).
